TODOS os problemas serão resolvidos com um design system mais eficiente, então, paciência:

- Nâo está claro o funcionamento e hieraquia da capa
  - PLayer está tocando oq?
  - Oq são as bolinhas?

- Navbar não está legal para 1366 (NEM para 1366, quebra o layout por conta da disposição dos elementos)
- Tamanho dos botões e espaçamentos precisam ser equalizados
- Imagens portraint = MORTE!
- Alinhamento dos botÕes de navegação nas categorias (tem que alinhar ao centro, mas ESTÁ de fato alinhado ao centro... mas não da imagem, sim do container... por enquanto fica assim)
-
